For the code in C, work was distributed fairly evenly with both of us working individually and consolidating a final version on GitHub.
However certain functions were taken individually such as Hoi Pong(Jason) taking the main role on the cipher and keys and Nigel taking
the co-prime check and alphabet filter. One thing worked on together would be coming up with the algorithem to come up with a variable
in a simplified form to add/subtract to the cipher key. When implementing in ARM, Jason took over the lead as the 'driver' for the majority 
of the work and Nigel mainly the 'navigator'. Roles occasionally swapped if meeting in person in labs. However most meetings occured online 
so it was logistically sound to have one person driving. ARM was commented on frequently during coding so no massive cleanup or commenting was 
necessary at the end. Overall the experience was positive and we worked well together.
